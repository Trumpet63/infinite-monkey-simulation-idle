*/

/* UI things I could do
Only one computer slot the whole time
Have there be a computer tower that also needs
to be upgraded to un-cap the max letters per second

Only one typing target the whole time
*/

/* Notes
When the user arranges the keys on their keyboard,
it should preserve the order they put it in, even
though it functionally doesn't matter 

buying/setting keys should be a big focus of the game
    I want the player to discover the fact that
    you can optimize income by putting multiples
    of the same key on the keyboard
    I want selecting the keys to be the most
    expensive part of the game
    I don't want keys to be generic, they should
    have to select each letter individually
    To make this scale as the player gets more
    money, this has to be controlled through the
    number of slots on the keyboard.
