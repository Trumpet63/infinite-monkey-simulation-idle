target string = "CAT"
keyboard = "C"

I have one letter in common with the target string,
but that one letter is the only one I can type, so
I have a 100% chane matching one letter

target string = "CAT"
keyboard = "C", "A"

1/2 C
1/2 A

I have a 1/4 chance of getting both, and a 2/4 chance
of getting one.

In general if the target string is N distinct letters, 
and I can type K of them, then
1 match  : K(K - 1)^(K - 1) / K^K
         = ((K - 1) / K) ^ (K - 1)

K matches: 1 / K^K


target string = "CATS"
keyboard = "C", "A", "T"

1 match: K(K - 1)^(K - 1) / K^K
